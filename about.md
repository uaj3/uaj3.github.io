I’m currently a Director of Engineering at Twitter where I’m responsible for storage, publish subscribe and real time stream processing systems that store and process mission critical data for Twitter. I have built and managed PB scale services that serve close to 100s of millions of requests/sec. I joined Twitter as a Sr. Engineer in 2014 and have been building and leading teams for the last 4+ years. I take immense pride in mentoring and coaching people and helping them reach their aspirations and at the same time creating high performing teams.

Before Twitter, I was at Oracle working in the Parallel Execution group. I was fortunate to get an opportunity to make contributions to the database optimizer and parallel execution engine. My work at Oracle has featured in a [VLDB Conference](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/2536222.2536235) and [patents](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/unmesh-jagtap). I joined Oracle after I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science from Cornell University with focus on database systems.

I’m expanding my engineering and leadership skills by pursuing an Executive MBA from the Wharton School. Getting a rigorous B-school degree while working full time is a challenging yet one of the most rewarding things I have done in my life. Hoping to use this space to share my thoughts on technology, leadership and product management.
