I’m a Director of Engineering at Twitter where I’m responsible for storage, publish subscribe and real time stream processing systems that store and process mission critical data for Twitter.  I joined Twitter as a Sr. Engineer in 2014 and have been building and leading teams for the last 4+ years. I take pride in mentoring and coaching people and helping them reach their aspirations while creating high performance teams.

Before Twitter, I was at Oracle working in the Parallel Execution group where I made contributions to the database optimizer and parallel execution engine. My work at Oracle has featured in a [VLDB Conference](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/2536222.2536235) and is covered by 2 [patents](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/unmesh-jagtap). I joined Oracle after graduating with a Masters degree in Computer Science from Cornell University.

Since 2019, I have been pursuing an Executive MBA from the Wharton School. Getting a rigorous B-school degree while working full time and coping with the COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenging yet one of the most rewarding things I have done in my life.
