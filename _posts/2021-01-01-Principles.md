![Principles by Ray Dalio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uaj3/unmeshjagtap.github.io/master/images/principles.jpg)

Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975 and served as the CEO for more than 40 years. He transformed Bridgewater into the biggest hedge fund with $160 billion in assets as of 2019. Dalio grew up in a middle class Long Island neighborhood. He learned about trading stocks from golfers for whom he caddied. When his $300 investment in Northeast Airlines tripled after a merger with another airline, he found his passion at age 12 and pursued it relentlessly for more than 50 years. After earning an MBA from Harvard Business School, Dalio held jobs in commodities at Dominick & Dominick and Shearson Hayden Stone. When Dalio was fired from Shearson, he started his own investment management firm, Bridgewater Associates.

While at Shearson, Dalio built a strong network of brokers, clients and peers who hired him for advice. He built a niche understanding of livestock, meat and grain markets and innovated by building regression models on his pocket calculator and systematically analyzed the relationships that drove these markets. Dalio wrote down investment principles that made him successful in these markets and refined his models to automate decision making. A holistic and innovative approach to investing that was clearly ahead of his time allowed him to catch economic and market trends that others missed.

In the early 1980’s, Dalio adjusted the blend of his assets because he predicted that a depression would hit the U.S. economy. However, the economy responded to the Fed’s rescue efforts and rebounded with the greatest growth period in its history. Bridgewater lost so much money that Dalio had to borrow $4000 from his father to make ends meet. He was embarrassed by his public failure as he had confidently advanced his position when he testified in Congress and appeared in the media. Reflecting on this experience, Dalio learned that one can never be sure about their own viewpoints. It taught him to be radically open minded as acknowledged by him in this video from a Bloomberg interview.

Radical open mindedness requires exploring different viewpoints without letting one’s ego or blind spots get in the way of making best decisions. It requires one to replace their attachment to always being right with the joy of learning truth. Effectively triangulating the views of many smart people simultaneously can accelerate quality decision making as one can see things sooner and wider by leveraging the experience of trusted advisors with a track record of successful outcomes. Dalio attributes his success to the quality of his decisions and habits. He encoded his decisions in computers as investment principles, which became automatic habits.

From my personal experience, practicing radical open mindedness begins with self awareness and humility. For me, it reinforces the message that [Janet Foutty](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/profiles/jfoutty.html) delivered to our Wharton cohort. Asking for help is NOT a sign of weakness. Dalio learned while studying neuropsychology that people are wired differently and that they have unique strengths. Radical open mindedness allows one to leverage complementary strengths and unique intrinsic motivations to achieve common goals - classic [McClelland's Theory of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_theory).

In 1983, Dalio received a memo from his employees suggesting that his way of operating had a negative effect on the company. Dalio realized that people who didn’t know him well were offended by his directness. As per Dalio, being direct and truthful was a byproduct of practicing radical open mindedness. His continued work with neuropsychology led him to understand this reaction as a fight between emotional and logical parts of the brain. Although the logical brain understands the benefits, the emotional brain sees directness as a threat. It was clear to Dalio that his radical open mindedness had to be supplemented with transparency so that he could be understood. He created principles for dealing with each other that required everyone to surface problems and have thoughtful disagreements, creating a safe environment for failure and learning. Bridgewater adopted several unusual practices such as recording all meetings and making confidential material available to its employees, increasing trust and driving meaningful relationships.

Best Leaders are also Great teachers. In 2011, Dalio decided to transition from the CEO role to be the board chairman. About a year into this transition, he realized that his managers were unable to see the patterns in people’s behavior and were subjected to personal biases and emotional barriers. However, the investment side used algorithms and analytics to connect the dots efficiently without bias. Dalio decided to put his management principles into decision rules through a variety of tools available to his managers. Dalio chose an atypical but resilient path for imparting his learnings to his organization.

**Pain + Reflection = Progress** is a profound equation from Dalio’s book. I have personally used pain as a guide to reflect upon problems. Dalio’s creative genius lies in his multidisciplinary approach to borrowing ideas from various fields and people to solve problems by reflecting upon them. Reflection should be a part of every leader’s checklist as it allows them to consider second and third order consequences of their decisions, promoting long term orientation.

Principles is one of those books that you read and then read again. I have augmented my leadership checklist with many ideas from this book that include radical open mindedness, transparency, approach to systematize life and leadership principles, generosity with people, and daily reflection. This is a must read book for every leader.
